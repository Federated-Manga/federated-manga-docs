# Federated Manga Specification <!-- omit in toc -->

Federated Manga seeks to define a content distribution protocol for a network of manga serving instances, ensuring that users will never have to live in fear of a single large service failing, resulting in extended downtime or major loss of content.

The specification builds on the shoulders of giants, such as the [Matrix Protocol](https://matrix.org/), the various @Home CDN projects, and [IPFS](http://ipfs.io/).
