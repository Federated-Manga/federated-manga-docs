[{"body":" This is a placeholder page that shows you how to use this template site.\n The Overview is where your users find out about your project. Depending on the size of your docset, you can have a separate overview page (like this one) or put your overview contents in the Documentation landing page (like in the Docsy User Guide).\nTry answering these questions for your user in this page:\nWhat is it? Introduce your project, including what it does or lets you do, why you would use it, and its primary goal (and how it achieves it). This should be similar to your README description, though you can go into a little more detail here if you want.\nWhy do I want it? Help your user know if your project will help them. Useful information can include:\n  What is it good for?: What types of problems does your project solve? What are the benefits of using it?\n  What is it not good for?: For example, point out situations that might intuitively seem suited for your project, but aren’t for some reason. Also mention known limitations, scaling issues, or anything else that might let your users know if the project is not for them.\n  What is it not yet good for?: Highlight any useful features that are coming soon.\n  Where should I go next? Give your users next steps from the Overview. For example:\n Getting Started: Get started with $project Examples: Check out some example code!

For example, you may want to add some conceptual pages if you have a large project with many components and a complex architecture.\nRemember to focus on what the user needs to know, not just what you think is interesting about your project! If they don’t need to understand your original design decisions to use or contribute to the project, don’t put them in, or include your design docs in your repo and link to them. Similarly, most users will probably need to know more about how features work when in use rather than how they are implemented.

Servers use these APIs to push catalog changes to each other in real-time, and to retrieve older catalog entries from each other. Much of the design is borrowed from the Matrix project and has simply been adapted for use with manga distribution. One key difference is that the Server-Server (Federation) API should also be used by (e.g. mobile) clients for the health of the network, to reduce the impact of having a large proportion of leechers.\nServer Discovery Servers and Load Balancers Anyone can host a server, but some scanlators will put themselves in charge of extremely popular manga, attracting a weekly DDoS. To combat this, servers should advertise a volunteer’s server, who are trusted to mirror the catalog and keep it alive even if the main server goes down.\nWhy this design? This design is a compromise in a world without IPFS-hosted catalogs. Individual instances are fully capable of doing their own load balancing using multiple DNS records, HAProxy, or cloud services, but on failure they will still take their entire catalog down with them. With this design, new users will not be able to access the catalog, but it will still be cached for old users.\nOf course, the final solution is to host the actively updated catalog on a P2P swarm. But such a thing has never been made nor proven to work. IPFS with IPNS/Namecoin/etc. are too complicated, and no one really understands how to design an application with these tools. Much of this work would be completely deprecated by a competent fully P2P design.\nNever forget that whatever we make needs to be usable by those with no technical expertise. Until we have a design revelation, this is the compromise we need to work with.\n GET https://example.com/.well-known/manga/servers   Gets information of delegated servers for server-server communication between federated manga servers.

The version format depends on the implementation.  { \"server\": { \"name\": \"go-federated-manga\", \"version\": \"0.0.1\" } }   Signing Keys Federation allows third party servers to mirror releases by scanlation groups. In order to prevent a user’s orders of christmas cake being replaced by cheese pizza, the amount of “dude trust me” needs to be minimized. To do this, we use asymmetric keys to sign releases by groups, and catalogs from servers. The concept is more-or-less analogous to package management mirroring in Linux.\nThe issue is further confounded by the fact that federated networks don’t have trusted third parties. The design is borrowed from the Matrix protocol, which allows servers to act as a witness (aka notary), claiming to know the published signing key of an offline server. More witnesses will result in less “dude trust me”.\nNOTE: The server hosting the original releases always has “dude trust me”. In other words, if multiple scanlation groups decide to congregate at a single server, every group needs to give the server absolute trust.\n GET https://manga.example.com/v1/keys   Gets the server’s published signing keys. The server may have any number of active keys and may have a number of old keys.\nIntermediary witnesses should cache a response for half of its lifetime to avoid serving a stale response. Originating servers should avoid returning responses that expire in less than an hour to avoid repeated requests for a certificate that is about to expire. Requesting servers should limit how frequently they query for certificates to avoid flooding a server with requests.\nIf the server fails to respond to this request, intermediary witnesses should continue to return the last response they received from the server so that others may make use of the witness to check signatures of old events.\n Rate-limited: No Requires authentication: No   Request No request parameters or request body.\n Responses Status Description 200\nThe server’s keys\n  200 Response Old Verify Key Name\nType\nDescription\nexpired_ts\ninteger\nRequired: POSIX timestamp in milliseconds for when this key expired. key\nstring\nRequired: The Unpadded base64 encoded key.
